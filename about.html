      <div class="about">
          <p> 
              My background includes being a Registered Nurse for the past 11yrs. I unfortunately experienced a few workplace injuries as a nurse, including multiple back injuries, that eventually lead to me to having emergency back surgery and not being able to return to my nursing career as it was too physically demanding.
          </p>
          <p>
              So I decided to give school another go as my head and hands still work! I'm in Semester 4 of the Software Development course at Keyin College receiving Micro-Credentials after every semester! I am really enjoying this program and also how different it is from nursing is exciting yet terrifying! I did however have a client-contracted paid project during Semester 2 with 5 other team members which was a really good experience and a little preview into the life of a Software Developer!
