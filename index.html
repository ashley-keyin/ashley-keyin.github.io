                <p><h1>Shiny Tracker</h1><br>In Semester 2 of the Software Development course at Keyin College, we were assigned a team to recreate/develop a web-based app using HTML, CSS and JS. Me and my teammate Nicholas created a Pokemon Shiny Tracker program to calculate the percentage of finding another Shiny Pokemon. This was one of the first web programs created in this course! Definitely a learning experience, and the programs only became more detailed and design-savvy as the semester went on!</p>

                <p><h1>Okie-Dokie Karaoke</h1><br> is a karaoke web-based app that was created using React JS. It fetches karaoke videos from YouTube and displays them on our website. We also purchased the domain name http://www.okiedokiekaraoke.com.

                <p>
                This was a semester 2 sprint project as well I completed with 2 other classmates Justin and Mark. It is vibrant, fun and easy to use! Grab a mic and pick a song!

                <p><h1>Skills Accelerator</h1><br>is a Micro-Credential Web App that myself and 5 other teammates created in Semester 2, in collaboration with Business Students at Northern College in Ontario. The App includes streamlined “courses” and each Micro-Credential is completely online and is also a work at your own pace set-up for continued learning.    
                </p>

                <p>The Micro-Credential App allows users to review the learning material and skills covered in the micro-credentials at any time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While creating this app I learned so much about team work, more in depth learning of how to use javascript and CSS and also some backend server development like mySQL and AWS S3 buckets, and develop a full entire working app that was a client-contracted paid project, and the client absolutely loved it!

                <p><h1>Really Rad Retail</h1><br> Really Rad Retail is a database search engine program that allows you to search for items in a mock retail database. Both PostGreSQL and MongoDB were used to connect and search the databases. I love design and just had a little fun color matching details!
